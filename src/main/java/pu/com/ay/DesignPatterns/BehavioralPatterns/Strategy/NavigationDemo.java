/*
 * Strategy Pattern Implementation for Navigation System
 * 
 * The Strategy pattern is useful because it:
 * 1. Eliminates large conditional statements (if-else chains)
 * 2. Makes it easy to add new routing algorithms without modifying existing code
 * 3. Allows runtime switching between different algorithms
 * 4. Promotes code reusability and maintainability
 * 5. Follows the Open-Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification)

/*
 * SUMMARY: Why Strategy Pattern is Useful
 * 
 * 1. FLEXIBILITY: Easy to switch algorithms at runtime
 * 2. MAINTAINABILITY: Each algorithm is isolated and can be modified independently
 * 3. EXTENSIBILITY: New algorithms can be added without changing existing code
 * 4. TESTABILITY: Each strategy can be unit tested in isolation
 * 5. CLEAN CODE: Eliminates complex conditional statements
 * 6. SOLID PRINCIPLES: Follows Single Responsibility and Open-Closed principles
 * 7. REUSABILITY: Strategies can be reused in different contexts
 * 8. POLYMORPHISM: Client works with strategies through common interface
 * 
 * Real-world applications:
 * - Payment processing (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer)
 * - Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort)
 * - Compression algorithms (ZIP, RAR, 7Z)
